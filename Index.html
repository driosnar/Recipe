        <div class = "body2"> <b>Start by boiling 5 quarts of water:</b> fill a large stockpot with water and set the heat to bring it to a boil then continue to the next step
    <p>
        <b>Lightly roast some chiles then boil with 3 cups of hot water:</b> clean the inside of the chiles and heat it up over a cast iron on medium heat.  Lightly roast them until they are soft.  After they are tender then add them to the cup of hot water and cover
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cook the pork:</b> put a tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan on medium high heat.  sprinkle the pork with garlic and salt before placing them in the hot oil to fry.  Best way to cook them is in batches so they do not overcook.  Stir until they are brown
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>add the pork and spices to the large pot of boiling water:</b> After cooking all the pork to brown nuggets, move them to the large pot with boiling water and them all to the mix.  Later add the Hominy into the mix and stir.  
    </p>
    <p>
        During this stage you can add the bay leaves, cumin, and oregano to the mix. DO NOT add the oregano in chunks as it will lead to a unplesant texture.  Ground up the Oregano leaves in the palm of your hands over the pot to sprink it in.

        <div class = "cooking"><h4><u>Cooking</u></h4>
     <div class = "body2">
         <b>prep the sauce:</b> Use a blender to puree the chilis into a sauce.  Add about 2 1/2 cups of water to the mix and 4 cloves of garlic.  After the sauce is done pureeing, run it through a sifter over the boiling pot to remove any ungrinded chunks.
    <p>
        <b>Cook for 2 to 3 hours:</b> after mixing in the sauce, it will turn a see through red.  While it boils remove any fat that travels to the top and taste to see the quaility of taste.  Add salt appropriately
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>table prep:</b> while the soup is cooking prepare your garnish for the dish by cutting up radishes and limes.  You want to have them around as they compliment the hot dish.  Limes are ideal as they have more natural flavors than bottled lime juice and provide the dish with pulp for enhanced textures.
